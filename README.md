Purple Entertainment is for the spontaneous traveler to Washington, DC. Whether they're on a business trip, or a leisure family vacation, they'll be able to use this application to find things to do around the city. From restaurants, to museums, to hotels - Purple Entertainment has you covered! For [centuries](https://www.livescience.com/33324-purple-royal-color.html), the color purple has been associated with royalty, power and wealth. Our aim is to convey a sophisticated brand that caters to the a traveler who enjoys the finer things.

## **Motivation**

This project showcases some of the skills that we've gained at George Washington University's Full Stack Web Development Boot Camp. We wanted to create something that was not only dynamic, but also useful. Further, this project supports local businesses, and can even be used by DC residents who want to explore all that this city has to offer.

## **Code Style**

## **Technologies and frameworks used**

**Built with**

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and Custom CSS
- Vanilla [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
- [Foursquare](https://foursquare.com/) API
- [Google Maps](https://maps.google.com/) API
- [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org/) API

## **Features**

- Dynamic Google Maps updates to page, and allows user to stay on the web app, and switch to other features for other information.
- Foursquare integrations offers information about the venue's popularity.
- Users can also check weather forecast to plan their day to day activities while in the city. For example, if it's a rainy day, travelers can plan to spend time in nearby museums instead of visiting the Reflecting Pool.
- Responsive web application design allows different types of devices to access information.

## **Code Example**

When a Google Marker is clicked, the placeâ€™s details are added to a modul:

    google.maps.event.addListener(marker, 'click', function() {
        var placeDetailsTitle = (place.name)
        var placeDetailsModal = ('<div><img src="' + place.photos["0"].getUrl({
            'maxWidth': 200,
            'maxHeight': 200
            }) + '">' + '<br>' + place.formatted_address + '<br>' + 'Average User Rating: ' + place.rating + '/5' + '<br>' + 'Price Level: ' + place.price_level + '/5' + '<br>' + 'Phone Number: ' + place.international_phone_number + '<br>' + 'Official site: ' + '<a href="' + place.website + '">' + place.website + '</a>' + '<br>' + 'User Feedback: ' + place.reviews["0"].author_name + '<br>' + 'Comments: ' + place.reviews["0"].text + '<br>' + '<br>' + 'Checkins: ' + popularity + '</div>');

    $("#markerName").text(placeDetailsTitle)
    $("#markerCheckins").append(placeDetailsModal)

    popularity = checkins.response.venue.stats.checkinsCount
    $("#markerCheckins1").text(popularity)

    //document.getElementById("#markerCheckins").innerHTML = popularity;
    **console.log("checkins:", popularity);**

    });

## **How to use?**
